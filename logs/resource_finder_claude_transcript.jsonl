# ✓ Resource Finding Phase COMPLETE

I have successfully completed the resource gathering phase for your research project on "An Artificial Token Language for More Efficient LLMs". Here's what has been accomplished:

## 📚 Resources Gathered

### Papers (8 total, 16 MB)
- **Byte Latent Transformer (2024)** - Tokenizer-free architecture at 8B scale
- **Tokenization Matters (2024)** - Demonstrates tokenization limitations
- **ReTok (2024)** - High-compression tokenizers
- **Theory of Tokenization (2025)** - Renyi efficiency framework
- **Language Modeling is Compression (2023)** - Theoretical foundation
- **Length-MAX Tokenizer (2024)** - 18.5% training speedup demonstrated
- **ARC-Encoder (2024)** - 4-8x compression via learned representations
- **BPE is Suboptimal (2020)** - Unigram LM baseline

### Datasets (4 total, ~350 MB)
- **WikiText-2** (36K train) - Quick iteration
- **WikiText-103** (1.8M train) - Primary benchmark
- **LAMBADA** (5K test) - Context understanding
- **GLUE MRPC** (3.6K train) - Downstream tasks

### Code Repositories (3 total)
- **Byte Latent Transformer** (Meta/Facebook)
- **LM Evaluation Harness** (EleutherAI)
- **SentencePiece** (Google)

## 📝 Documentation Created

1. **literature_review.md** (18 pages) - Comprehensive synthesis with methodology, findings, and recommendations
2. **resources.md** - Complete catalog of all resources
3. **papers/README.md** - Detailed paper descriptions
4. **datasets/README.md** - Dataset documentation with download instructions
5. **code/README.md** - Repository setup and usage guides
6. **RESOURCE_FINDER_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary
7. **.resource_finder_complete** - Completion marker

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Tokenization is a bottleneck** - Current approaches are inherently limiting
2. **Significant gains are achievable** - 14-18% token reduction, 18.5% training speedup demonstrated in literature
3. **Alternatives are viable** - BLT (tokenizer-free), ARC (learned compression), Unigram (better than BPE)
4. **Theoretical framework exists** - Renyi efficiency, compression metrics
5. **Research gap identified** - No systematic study of purpose-designed artificial token languages

## 🎯 Recommendations for Experiments

- **Primary Dataset**: WikiText-103
- **Baselines**: BPE (32K), Unigram LM (32K)
- **Model Scale**: Start at 124M-350M params
- **Success Criteria**: ≥10% fewer tokens, equal perplexity, ≥5% faster training (minimum)

## 📂 Workspace Organization

```
workspace/
├── papers/              # 8 research papers
├── datasets/            # 4 downloaded datasets
├── code/                # 3 cloned repositories

└── .resource_finder_complete
```

## ✅ Validation Status

All checklist items completed:
- ✓ Papers downloaded and documented
- ✓ Datasets downloaded with git-friendly setup (.gitignore)
- ✓ Code repositories cloned
- ✓ Comprehensive literature review created
- ✓ Resources catalog completed
- ✓ Completion marker created

**Time Invested**: ~3 hours (within recommended budget)  
**Total Storage**: ~400 MB

## 🚀 Next Steps

The workspace is ready for the **Experiment Runner** phase, which will:
1. Set up environment and install dependencies
2. Train baseline tokenizers (BPE, Unigram)
3. Design artificial token language
4. Train and evaluate models
5. Compare results against baselines

All resources are organized, documented, and validated. The experiment runner can now proceed with implementation and evaluation.
