  title: An Artificial Token Language for More Efficient LLMs
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Training large language models on a compact artificial token language,
    designed to be highly expressive and universal, will reduce model inefficiency
    and resource consumption compared to training on token-heavy natural languages
    like English, while maintaining similar reasoning quality.

    '
  background:
    description: "Today I\u2019m thinking about how to make LLMs less inefficient\
      \ and more sustainable.\nSome papers show that English is token-heavy, while\
      \ other languages can express the same reasoning with far fewer tokens and similar\
      \ in quality. That made me wonder: instead of fighting over which human language\
      \ is most efficient, why not build an artificial one? We can make a small, universal\
      \ set of highly expressive tokens. We map any human language into this compact\
      \ code, train the model in that code space, then decode back to normal text\
      \ (like compiling in programming).\nIf this works, we might get much smaller,\
      \ faster models that reason better with fewer tokens."
